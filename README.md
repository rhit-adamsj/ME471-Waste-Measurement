Repository for RHIT ME471-Campus Waste Measurement Project

# Installation Instructions

Right click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhit-adamsj/ME471-Waste-Measurement/refs/heads/main/Programs/AutonomousWasteMeasurement/AutonomousWasteMeasurement.ino) and select "Save link as..." Save this file wherever you would like, but the easier to find the better. You can now open the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/), then open the file you saved from this repository within the IDE. A prompt will likely appear warning you that the file must exist in an empty folder and ask you if you would like to create one, if so select "Yes." Once the file is opened, connect the Arduino to the current device using the Serial USB cable, then press the "Upload Sketch" button. Alternatively, you can open the "Programs/AutonomousWasteMeasurement" folder, then select "AutonomousWasteMeasurement.ino" to view the code directly. This code can then be copied and pasted into a new sketch, and uploaded to the Arduino Mega 2560.
